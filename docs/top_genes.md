# Highlighted Top Genes Per Condition

Examined top 10 genes for each condition, arranged by r-squared if FDR corrected p value 
was less than 0.01, based on a linear model predicting S-Score from paff, gene expression
and protein abundance.
The majority of top genes appear to have general metabolic functions, here I note those
that appear linked to the condition or otherwise notable

## 20ºC (48H)

* YOR020C - top gene is HSP10, a heat shock protein
* YOR027W - Evolutionarily-conserved Hsp90 cochaperone

## 20ºC/39ºC  (48H/72H)

* YOR020C - heat shock protein

## Amphotericin B (48H) and Amphotericin B + anaerobic (48H)

Neither has obvious genes standing out, but they do overlap quite a bit, suggesting
the genes are linked to conditions rather than random metabolism

## Caspofungin (48H)

* YMR311C - Involved in glycogen metabolism, which could link to cell wall (the target of the drug)

## Paraquat (48H)

* YGR132C - Subunit of the prohibitin complex (Phb1p-Phb2p); prohibitin is an inner 
  mitochondrial membrane chaperone that stabilizes newly synthesized proteins. Paraquat 
  works by inhibiting electron transport
